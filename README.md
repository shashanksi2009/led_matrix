###Game features :-
 ####1> Infinite Levels generation
 ####2> 1.5 minutes level
 ####3> All ( paddle , blocks and balls ) are randomized
 ####4> Supports extra spin
 ####5> Fixed maximum score for particular level
 ####6> Stores higest score and username in EEPROM
 ####7> Supports breaking bricks tone
 ####8> No extra LCD required , all data is shown on big LED display such as Level name , score , highest score , username ,etc. 
 ####9> Interactive Game
 ####10> Name can be enter using 360 degree 1k potentiometer joystick control (All 26 alphabets can be used using POTENTIOMETER Joystick which we call as " Funstick " 
 ####11> Block size , ball and paddle speed changed according to LEVEL
 ####12> Ball speed even changes in a level
 ####13> Follows the law of momentum
